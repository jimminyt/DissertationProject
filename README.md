# DissertationProject

Final year university dissertation project by James Taylor

This project works with Augmented Reality (AR), a technology where virtual
data such as images and objects are placed in the real world through a camera
feed. This technology is now widely available due to the rise of smartphones with
good quality cameras and in-built AR software. In AR, when virtual objects in
an environment pass behind a real object the virtual object should be hidden in
places that are behind the real object, just as it would be with two real objects.
This problem is known as occlusion and by solving it, AR programs can become
more immersive as the virtual objects actually feel part of the scene.

The solution has been coded using the AR tools available through Unity game engine and coded in C#.

Completed April 2020.
